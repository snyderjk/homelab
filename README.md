# 🧪 Kubernetes Homelab — Self-Hosted Cloud Infrastructure

Welcome! This repo documents my personal Kubernetes homelab—a hands-on project to deepen my skills in DevOps, cloud-native infrastructure, and system administration. This environment emulates a small-scale production setup and is used to deploy, manage, and monitor real-world applications.

## ⚙️ Architecture Overview

- **Control Plane**:  
  - Host: Dell laptop with NVIDIA RTX 3060 Mobile GPU  
  - OS: Ubuntu Server  
  - Installed via: `kubeadm`  
  - Purpose: API server, scheduler, controller manager, GPU inference workloads (e.g., Mistral 7B)

- **Worker Nodes** (3 total):  
  - CPU: 4 cores each  
  - RAM: 16 GB each  
  - Storage: 256 GB HDD  
  - OS: Ubuntu Server  
  - Managed via `kubeadm join`

- **CNI Plugin**: Calico  
- **Load Balancer**: MetalLB  
- **Ingress**: NGINX  
- **Networking**: VLAN segmentation via pfSense and UniFi gear  
  - VLANs for home network, homelab, IoT, security devices, and work access

## 🚀 Deployed Applications

- **Linkding** — Self-hosted bookmark manager (externally accessible)  
- **Homepage** — Personal dashboard with service health and quick links  
- **UniFi Admin Controller** — Network controller running in-cluster  
- **Monitoring Stack (in progress)** — Prometheus + Grafana + node-exporter

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- **GitOps**-ready: Declarative YAML deployments and Git-based config tracking  
- **Self-Hosted LLM Inference**: Mistral 7B running with `llama-cpp-python`, GPU accelerated  
- **Public Access**: Select services exposed using secure ingress with Let's Encrypt  
- **Security Best Practices**: Role-based access control (RBAC), namespace isolation, and VLAN-based network segmentation  
- **Automation**: Plans to integrate Ansible for repeatable provisioning and CI/CD with GitHub Actions

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Prepare for **CKA** and **AWS Solutions Architect – Associate** certifications  
- Master **Linux system administration** (LFCS in progress)  
- Build expertise in **DevOps** and **cloud-native** technologies  
- Transition from software engineering to infrastructure and platform engineering

---

## 🛠️ Roadmap

- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment  
- [ ] Expand monitoring stack with alerts and dashboards  
- [ ] Integrate SSO for web services  
- [ ] Migrate homelab secrets to HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager  
- [ ] Publish blog tutorials based on homelab setup
